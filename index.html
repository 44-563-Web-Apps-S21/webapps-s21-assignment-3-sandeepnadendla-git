        <h3> My recomendations places to visit</h3>

        <h4> 1. Golden Temple</h4>
       <p>
           Amritsar is in PunjabState and is the spiritual centre of the Sikh religion.
            It might be surprising that the GoldenTemple, the holy Sikh temple receives more visitors 
            than the Taj Mahal. Built in the 16th Century, it is located in a beautiful and spectacular complex.
             When inside the GoldenTemple, one is well aware of the reverence paid to it by all visitors.
